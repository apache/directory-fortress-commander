contextId=HOME

# Used by application security components:
perms.cached=true

# Host name and port of LDAP DIT:
host=localhost
port=10389

# LDAP Server type.  Each LDAP server impl has different behavior on operations like password policies and audit.  If using a 3rd type of server that isn't formally supported, leave blank or type is other.
# If ApacheDS server:
ldap.server.type=apacheds
# Else if OpenLDAP server:
#ldap.server.type=openldap
# Else leave blank:
#ldap.server.type=other

# Set the credentials of service account.  Must have read/write privileges over the Fortress LDAP DIT:
# If ApacheDS it will look something like this:
admin.user=uid=admin,ou=system
admin.pw=secret
# Else If OpenLDAP it will look something like this:
# admin.user=cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com

# This is min/max settings for LDAP administrator pool connections that have read/write access to all nodes under suffix:
min.admin.conn=1
max.admin.conn=10

# To read the OpenLDAP audit log, need this service account:
#log.admin.user=cn=manager,cn=log
# For corresponding log user:
#log.admin.pw=secret

# Used for SSL Connection to LDAP Server:
#enable.ldap.ssl=true
#enable.ldap.ssl.debug=true
#trust.store=/fully/qualified/path/and/file/name/to/java/truststore
#trust.store.password=changeit
#trust.store.set.prop=true

# This node contains fortress properties stored on behalf of connecting LDAP clients:
config.realm=DEFAULT
config.root=ou=Config,dc=example,dc=com

# ApacheDS stores its password policies objects here by default:
apacheds.pwpolicy.root=ou=passwordPolicies,ads-interceptorId=authenticationInterceptor,ou=interceptors,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config

# enable this to see trace statements when connection pool allocates new connections:
debug.ldap.pool=true

# Default for pool reconnect flag is false:
enable.pool.reconnect=true

ehcache.config.file=ehcache.xml

# This will override default LDAP manager implementations for the RESTful ones:
#enable.mgr.impl.rest=true
enable.mgr.impl.rest=false

# Optional parameters needed when Fortress client is connecting with the En Masse (rather than LDAP) server:
http.user=demouser4
http.pw=gX9JbCTxJW5RiH+otQEX0Ja0RIAoPBQf
http.host=localhost
http.port=8080

# The default is 'false':
#enable.nav.panel=true

# Boolean value. Disabled by default. If this is set to true, the runtime will enforce administrative permissions and ARBAC02 DA checks:
is.arbac02=false
