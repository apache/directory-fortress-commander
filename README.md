-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 2. Download & Install

1. Download the source.

 a. from git:
 ```
 git clone --branch 2.0.3  https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/directory-fortress-commander.git/
 cd directory-fortress-commander
 ```

 b. or download package:

 ```
 wget http://www.apache.org/dist/directory/fortress/dist/2.0.3/fortress-web-2.0.3-source-release.zip
 unzip fortress-web-2.0.3-source-release.zip
 cd fortress-web-2.0.3
 ```

2. Build the source.

a. Java 8 target

 ```
 mvn clean install
 ```

-- OR --

b. Java 11 target

 ```
 mvn clean install -Djava.version=11
 ```

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 3. Get the fortress.properties

These contain the coordinates to the target LDAP server.

1. Copy the **fortress.properties**, created during **FORTRESS_CORE_HOME** **README.md**, to this package's resource folder.

 ```
 cp $FORTRESS_CORE_HOME/config/fortress.properties $FORTRESS_WEB_HOME/src/main/resources
 ```

2. Verify they match your target LDAP server.
 ```
 # This param tells fortress what type of ldap server in use:
 ldap.server.type=apacheds

 # ldap host name
 host=localhost

 # if ApacheDS is listening on
 port=10389

 # If ApacheDS, these credentials are used for read/write to fortress DIT
 admin.user=uid=admin,ou=system
 admin.pw=secret

 # This is min/max settings for admin pool connections:
 min.admin.conn=1
 max.admin.conn=10

 # This node contains more fortress properties stored on behalf of connecting LDAP clients:
 config.realm=DEFAULT
 config.root=ou=Config,dc=example,dc=com

 # Used by application security components:
 perms.cached=true

 # Fortress uses a cache:
 ehcache.config.file=ehcache.xml

 # Default for pool reconnect flag is false:
 enable.pool.reconnect=true
 ```

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 4. Load Sample Security Policy

Run maven install with load file:
```
mvn install -Dload.file=./src/main/resources/FortressWebDemoUsers.xml
```

 Notes:
  * This step must be completed before tests can be successfully run.
  * The [DelegatedAdminManagerLoad](https://github.com/apache/directory-fortress-core/blob/master/ldap/setup/DelegatedAdminManagerLoad.xml) must also be loaded into LDAP, for base policy req's.

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 5. Deploy to Tomcat Server

1. If Tomcat has global security enabled you must add credentials to pom.xml:

 ```
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version.tomcat.maven.plugin}</version>
        <configuration>
            ...
          <!-- Warning the tomcat manager creds here are for deploying into a demo environment only. -->
          <username>tcmanager</username>
          <password>m@nager123</password>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
 ```

2. copy **FORTRESS_REALM_HOME** proxy jar to **TOMCAT_HOME**/lib/

 ```
 cp $FORTRESS_REALM_HOME/proxy/target/fortress-realm-proxy-[version].jar $TOMCAT_HOME/lib
 ```

3. Restart Tomcat server.

4. Enter maven command to deploy to Tomcat:

 ```
 mvn tomcat:deploy
 ```

5. To redeploy:

 ```
 mvn tomcat:redeploy
 ```

6. Open browser and test (creds: test/password):

 ```
 http://hostname:8080/fortress-web
 ```

 where hostname is host or ip for your machine

___________________________________________________________________________________
## SECTION 6. Test with Selenium

1. There version of Webdriver being used for Selenium now requires downloading and installing the gecko (firefox) and/or chrome drivers as separate binary packages. For more info:
https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager

2. Once that download has been completed, you will need to set the location of the driver as a system.property.
 For example, these lines may need to be added to the FortressWebSeleniumITCase test class, or set via other means:

 ```
     @BeforeClass
     public static void setupClass()
     {
         System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "/home/user/drivers/geckodriver");
         System.setProperty( "webdriver.chrome.driver", "/home/user/drivers/chromedriver");
         ...
     }
 ```

2. Run the Selenium Web driver integration tests with Firefox (default):

 ```
 mvn test -Dtest=FortressWebSeleniumITCase
 ```

3. Run the tests using Chrome:

 ```
 mvn test -Dtest=FortressWebSeleniumITCase -Dweb.driver=chrome
 ```

 Note: These automated tests require that:
 * Either Firefox or Chrome installed to target machine.
 * **FORTRESS_CORE_HOME**/*FortressJUnitTest* successfully run.  This will load some test data to grind on.
 * **FORTRESS_CORE_HOME**/./setup/ldap/*FortressJUnitTest* successfully run.  This will load some test data to grind on.
 * [FortressWebDemoUsers](./src/main/resources/FortressWebDemoUsers.xml) policy loaded into target LDAP server.

## SECTION 7. Fortress Web properties

This section describes the properties needed to control fortress web.

1. LDAP Hostname coordinates.  The host name can be specified as a fully qualified domain name or IP address.

 ```
 # Host name and port of LDAP DIT:
 host=localhost
 port=10389
 ```

2. LDAP Server type.  Each LDAP server impl has different behavior on operations like password policies and audit.  If using a 3rd type of server that isn't formally supported, leave blank or type is other.

 ```
 # If ApacheDS server:
 ldap.server.type=apacheds
 ```

 ```
 # Else if OpenLDAP server:
 ldap.server.type=slapd
 ```

 ```
 # Else leave blank:
 #ldap.server.type=other
 ```

3.  Set the credentials of service account.  Must have read/write privileges over the Fortress LDAP DIT:

 ```
 # If ApacheDS it will look something like this:
 admin.user=uid=admin,ou=system
 admin.pw=secret
 ```

 ```
 # Else If OpenLDAP it will look something like this:
 admin.user=cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
 ```

4. Define the number of LDAP connections to use in the pool  This setting will be proportional to the number of concurrent users but won't be one-to-one.  The number of required ldap connections will be much lower than concurrent users:

 ```
 # This is min/max settings for LDAP connections.  For testing and low-volume instances this will work:
 min.admin.conn=1
 max.admin.conn=10
 ```

5. Give coordinates to the Config node that contains all of the other Fortress properties.  This will match your LDAP's server's config node per Fortress Core setup.

 ```
 # This node contains fortress properties stored on behalf of connecting LDAP clients:
 config.realm=DEFAULT
 config.root=ou=Config,dc=example,dc=com
 ```

6. If using LDAPS.

 ```
 # Used for SSL Connection to LDAP Server:
 enable.ldap.ssl=true
 enable.ldap.ssl.debug=true
 trust.store=/fully/qualified/path/and/file/name/to/java/truststore
 trust.store.password=changeit
 trust.store.set.prop=true
 ```

7. To use REST instead of LDAP.  Points to fortress-rest instance.

 ```
 # This will override default LDAP manager implementations for the RESTful ones:
 enable.mgr.impl.rest=true
 ```

8. If using REST, provide the credentials of user that has access to fortress-rest.

 ```
 # Optional parameters needed when Fortress client is connecting with the En Masse (rather than LDAP) server:
 http.user=demouser4
 http.pw=gX9JbCTxJW5RiH+otQEX0Ja0RIAoPBQf
 http.host=localhost
 http.port=8080
 ```

9. To reenable the nav panel on startup.

 ```
 # The default is 'false':
 enable.nav.panel=true
 ```

10. If using ApacheDS and setting password policies, point to the correction location.

 ```
 # ApacheDS stores its password policies objects here by default:
 apacheds.pwpolicy.root=ou=passwordPolicies,ads-interceptorId=authenticationInterceptor,ou=interceptors,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
 ```

11. The fortress web runtime will cache user's permissions in their session if set to true.

 ```
 # Used by application security components:
 perms.cached=true
 ```

12. Each instance of a fortress web can be scoped to one and only one tenant.  The default tenant is called HOME.

 ```
 # This is the default tenant or home context
 contextId=HOME
 ```

 ```
 # If you need to scope to a different tenant, supply its ID here:
 contextId=mytenantid
 ```
